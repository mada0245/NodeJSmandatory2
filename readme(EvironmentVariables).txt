we need to install the dependencies before running the projects

run frontEnd on http://localhost:5173/
the backEnd happens on http://localhost:8000/

This are the environment variables we need to define for the project to work

mada0245_jwtPrivateKey ---> this is the server pass for jason web token
NODEMAILER_USERNAME ---> this is the email we use to send email with nodemailer (it has to be an gmail account, has to exist and needs to be able to handle nodemailer)
NODEMAILER_PASSWORD ---> this is the password for your email or app password if with 2-step verification in the gmail
MADA0245_ADMIN_PASS ---> this is the password for the admin user (i made a note saying it is "pass" so you can set it like that if you wish)
